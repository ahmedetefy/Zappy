# Zappy

Zappy integrates Slack and Twitter by listening on a Slack Channel for the word 'GO'
and triggers an event to fetch all Twitter posts from a specific Twitter account.

## Accounts Information

For the Slack Account, Go to Slack Channel page [Here](https://zappycorp.slack.com)  

You will be prompted to enter credentials. Enter the following credentials.  

Email: ahmed.etefy12@gmail.com
Password: superadminpass@123  

Zappy listens to channel #general, and hence this is where the messages should be sent.
